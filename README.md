# Pijudo-New-Hud-Menu-System
An experimental menu system created with dhud!

Well this is a menu system per hud, I always wanted to make one when I was a teenager but I did not have the capacity to do it, so I share it with you. I publish it more as a contribution than as a plugin because the idea is that it is a guide and that they make the modifications that they believe necessary in terms of menu positions and elements.

The system uses 3 dhud: 1 for the title, X for the items and 1 for the Exit, Return, Next options.

Where X depends on the content of the elements, minimum 1 DHUD.

It has support for both static menus and dynamic menus.

Put HudMenu.amxx before your plugins that use the menu.

Important: the title of hud_menu_register and hud_menu_create_title must match!
